       ## What's the problem?
          Ever wondered how the news channels predict weather
          conditions accurately?It's beacause they leverage data 
          science,which is always working in the background in
          the process of weather preditcton.For all individuals
          and organizations,it is extremely useful to know accurate
          weather conditions. This helps buisness work with more
          accuracy and without any disruptions. In this challenge
          ,analyze and interpret various weather patterns,create
          weather forcast and develope visualizations to showcase 
          the results effectively.

Optimize Supply Chain Inventory
Effectively manage and optimize inventory by capturing variables such as lead times, manufac- turing frequency, batch size, and ordering policies from across the supply chain. Using algo- rithms, exception-based forecasts, and real-time downstream demand signals, suggest and adjust inventories to optimal levels. Maintain the right amount of inventory required to meet demand, keep logistics costs low, and avoid common inventory issues such as stockouts, over- stocking, and backorders.
