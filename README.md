   ## Short description
   
   ### What's the problem?
 Weather plays important role in agriculture,airlines,fishing,space science and tranporatation activities at coastal areas ;sometimes weather is extreme,causing 
 destruction .Heavy rain can cause flooding,too much hot weather for long time without rain can cause drought. Huge storms with strong winds,such as hurricanes and 
 tornadoes; can do  damage of money,natural resources also human lifes.
         
 
   ### How can technology help?
   
   For using historical data,  With the  help of technology  we predict weather forecasting.
   This weather prediction is depend upon IBM Whatson ,IBM cloud and python.
  
    
   ### The Idea
   With the help of historical data predict the weather conditions using machine learning and artificial intellegence.
   
   The idea of this project is that gives weather update of our customer.Anlyze the conditions and give some suggestions depending the on their field.
   
   For Agriculture- doing activities like plantation,land preparation,fertigation and spraying.
     
   For Airlines- deciding aeroplanes landing and takeoff time.
    
   For Fishing- knowing the information of thunderstorm and plan the fishing activites depending on them.
    
   For Space science- deciding the time and date of launching the satellite and also for other space activities.
    
   For transportation activities at coastal areas and sea-deciding the arrival and departure timing of ship.
   
   For Government-take some decision on climate change
