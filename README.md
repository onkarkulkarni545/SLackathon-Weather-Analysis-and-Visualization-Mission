   ## Short description
   
   ### What's the problem?
 Ever wondered how the news channels predict weather conditions accurately?It's beacause they leverage data science,which is always working in the background in the process of weather preditcton.For all individuals and organizations,it is extremely useful to know accurate  weather conditions. This helps buisness work with more accuracy and without any disruptions. In this challenge analyze and interpret various weather patterns,create  weather forcast and develope visualizations to showcase  the results effectively.
 
   ### How can technology help?
   
   For using historical data,  With the  help of technology  we predict weather forcasting.
   Weather plays important role in
                               Agriculture,
                               Airlines,
                               Fishing,
                               Space sciencce,
                               Transportation activities at coastsal areas and sea.
    
   ### The Idea
   With the help of historical data predict the weather conditions using machine learning and artificial intellegence.
   
   The idea of this project is that gives weather update of our customer.Anlyze the conditions and give some suggestions depending the on their field.
   For Agriculture- doing activities like plantation,land preparation,fertigation and spraying.
     
   For Airlines- deciding aeroplanes landing and takeoff time.
    
   For Fishing- knowing the information of thunderstorm and plan the fishing activites depending on them.
    
   For Space science- deciding the time and date of launching the satellite and also for other space activities.
    
   For transportation activites at coastal areas and sea-deciding the arrival and departure timing of ship.
